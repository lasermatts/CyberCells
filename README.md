# Python Sudoku Game

This is a simple and interactive Sudoku game created in Python. It allows users to choose between three levels of difficulty - easy, medium, and hard. The easy level corresponds to a 4x4 Sudoku grid, the medium level to a 6x6 grid, and the hard level to a 9x9 grid. 

## Distribution

Our first distribution is live on PyPI! 

See: https://pypi.org/project/CyberCells/0.1/ for more info!

## Installation

Before you run the game, you need to install the following dependencies:
`pip install numpy`

## Cloning The Repo To Your Local Machine
`git clone https://github.com/lasermatts/PyDoku.git`

## Running the Game
`cd CyberCells`
`python sudoku.py`

The game will prompt you to enter a difficulty level. Enter "easy", "medium", or "hard" to start the game. If you wish to quit the game, just type "q".

While solving the Sudoku, enter your solution in the format 'row col num', for instance '1 1 2' places the number 2 at the position (1,1). If you wish to quit at any point, you can type 'q'.
